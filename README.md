# Reactron-express

## What this project is

Built over the previous Reactron template, this version has an embedded express server instance, that can be started and stopped inside React. The communication with the server instance is done via ipcMain/ipcRenderer channels (event-based method).

Default port is 5000, but it can be changed to accept user input.

[ ] Configure babel to generate js file from es6 and Typescript files 

## How to build the application

First, just `npm install` to import and install the needed packages.

To create the executable application, just run `npm run make`. This will build the React application to the folder `/build` first and then pack it to the Electron executable, which will be built in the folder `/out`.

## Debugging

### On browser

In order to run the application on browser, the command is still the default `npm start`

### On a Electron executable

The command to run the debug React server on the electron executable is `npm run dev`. It starts the React server and when ready, opens `localhost:3000` on the Electron exe. No browser opens when starting React server (option BROWSER=none in .env).
